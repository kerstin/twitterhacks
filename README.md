Just miscellaneous Twitter hacks...

Firefox users who don't like the new, bright, white Twitter design (as of 14-02-04) can download [this .css file](/darktwitter/userContent.css) and save it to their FF profile directory to make the Twitter navigation bar and a few other boxes turn back to black.

The easiest way to find your profile folder is from within Firefox: click on the "Help" menu, select "Troubleshooting Information" and in the Troubleshooting tab that opens click the button next to where it says "Profile Folder".

Just drop the .css file in there, restart Firefox and voil√†!
