#darktwitter

Firefox users who don't like the new, bright, white Twitter design (as of 14-02-04) can download the above [userContent.css](userContent.css) file and save it to their FF profile directory (click through to the file and then on the "Raw" button to display it) to make the Twitter navigation bar and a few other boxes turn back to black.

The easiest way to find your profile folder is from within Firefox: Click on the "Help" menu, select "Troubleshooting Information" and in the Troubleshooting tab that opens click the button next to where it says "Profile Folder" - this should open your Firefox profile directory in your file browser.

Now navigate to the "chrome" folder inside this directory, drop the .css file into it, restart Firefox and voil√†!
