#darktwitter

##On Firefox
Firefox users who don't like the new, bright, white Twitter design (as of 14-02-04) can download the above [userContent.css](userContent.css) file and save it to their FF profile directory (click through to the file and then on the "Raw" button to display it) to make the Twitter navigation bar and a few other boxes turn back to black.

The easiest way to find your profile folder is from within Firefox: click on the "Help" menu, select "Troubleshooting Information" and in the Troubleshooting tab that opens click the button next to where it says "Profile Folder" - this should open your Firefox profile directory in your file browser.

Now navigate to the "chrome" folder inside this directory, drop the .css file into it, restart Firefox and voilÃ !

(To get rid of #darktwitter again and switch back to #newtwitter, just delete the userContent.css file from your chrome folder and restart FF.)

##On Chrome
Because I was asked about this, I added a quick (and super dirty) hack for Chrome too, though it looks like Chrome will not be supporting customised stylesheets [for much longer](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=53596).

Download the above [Custom.css](Custom.css) file (click through to the file and then on the "Raw" button to display it) and drop it into **Default > User Stylesheets** in your Chrome installation folder (on Mac, the full path to your Chrome installation is YourUserName/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome - I'd appreciate pointers on where it can be found on Windows).

The changes should take effect immediately, no need to restart Chrome.

(To get rid of #darktwitter again, just delete the Custom.css stylesheet from your User Stylesheets folder.)
